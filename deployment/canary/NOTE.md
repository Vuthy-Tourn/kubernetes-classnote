## Canary Deployment

Canary Deployment is a release strategy where a **new version of an application is released to a small group of users first** before rolling it out to everyone.

### How It Works
- Deploy a new version alongside the current version
- Route a small percentage of traffic to the new version
- Monitor performance, errors, and user feedback
- Gradually increase traffic if the new version is stable
- Roll back quickly if issues are detected

### Benefits
- ✅ Reduced risk during releases
- ✅ Real user testing in production
- ✅ Easy rollback with minimal impact

### Key Idea
Release changes **gradually and safely** by testing them with a small portion of real users first.
